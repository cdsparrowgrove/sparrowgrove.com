	<p>The majority of this website was built by Christopher Sparrowgrove and there is not doubt of the hours<BR />
	   of hard work and time that was placed in the development of the website and the applications<BR />
	   hosted here. In the making of this web site and the web application there were multiple sources<BR />
	   of where copyrighted work and self done work or assitance was aquired. Yes, Some work does belong<BR />
	   to 3rd parties but the majority of work belongs to the main Developer of this web site and web apps:<BR />
	   Christopher Sparrowgrove</p>
	   
	<p>Christopher has taken alot of time developing this website and many web applications but in the making of<BR />
	   He searched for code that was readly available for what he was building and if it wasn't he would use simalar<BR />
	   to modify and use as his own (with proper citation of course) but there was alot of code that did not already<BR />
	   exist or could not be used. So,  Christophers talent begins to show as he developed alot of the code on this site<BR />
	   in simalar license to those he has barrowed or used....Open Source.</p>
	   
	<p>Upon building this website Christopher took some interest in not only crediting the sources in his scripts but<BR />
	   creating a credits page where he could display all the sources and credits on one page for everyone to see<BR />
	   and that is why this page is here so withou further a due:</p>
	   
	<p>http://Christopher.Sparrowgrove.com Would Like to Thank:</p>

	   	    has helped me understand the cause of an error in my script <BR />
	   	    for /Maintance/index.php?code= which would set a null error code to the same value as zero.<P />
	   	    
	   	This script I developed will allow my users to check the status of my website anytime and<BR />
	   	surprisingly it is not a very creative script but it works for me and gives me experiance.<BR />
	   	     </li>
	   	<li><a herf="http://php.net">PHP.net</a> has also helped me with structuring and debugging some of my code.<BR />
	   	I did not get a chance to use or view comments from other developer but I did learn to debug my code on my own<BR />
	   	which I gained a lot of usefull knowlegde from doing.</li>
